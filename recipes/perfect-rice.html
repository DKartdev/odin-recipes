    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Perfect rice is soft, fluffy, and not sticky. Each grain is cooked evenly and 
        lightly separated. This method works well for white rice (like basmati or long-grain).</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>Wash the rice. Put the rice in a bowl and rinse it with water 2–3 times until the water looks clearer. This removes extra starch.</li>
            <li>Boil the water. In a pot, add 2 cups of water and bring it to a boil. </li>
            <li>Add rice and salt. Add the washed rice and salt. Stir once.</li>
            <li>Cook on low heat. Cover the pot, reduce heat to low, and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest the rice. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit (covered) for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fluff and serve. Use a fork to gently fluff the rice. Serve warm.</li>
            
        </ol>
